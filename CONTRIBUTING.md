# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make by creating an issue
or any other method with a developer of the team before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Commit Standards

1. Keep commits regular, concise, and as targeted to the specific issue/branch as possible.
2. Commits should follow a single [template](https://url_to_template.com). They should include a heading, inform the reader of all changes
done in an imperative fashion, and reason for these changes. They may include TODOs.
3. All commit messages should include a reference to the relevant issue. Done by ```See #13``` or ```Closes #13```.
Note: The latter **automatically closes the issue**.
4. For more information on commit standards, please read [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Branching Structure

1. Ensure that an issue with appropriate title and description is created for each change you would
like to make to the repository. As a rule of thumb, each new feature should have its own issue or may
be grouped with other simillar (smaller) features.
2. Create a new branch, corresponding to the issue. Its name should also include the issue number. For
example, ```14-login-form``` is a good branch name for an issue number 14 called ```Create Login Form```.
3. Push all changes to the branch relevant to the issue. This branch might also be used in the future to
push any fixes/enhancements relevant to the feature.
4. When the feature is done, a Merge Request to master could be opened. See Merge Request process below.

## Merge Request Process

1. Ensure that a Merge Request contains not more than 500 code changes (additions and deletions).
2. Ensure any unneeded install or build dependencies are removed before the creating a Merge Request.
3. Update any relevant documentation (README.md, Wiki pages, etc.) with details of changes to the
interface. This includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container
parameters.
4. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, 
5. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Merge Request would represent. We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
6. You may merge the Merge Request in once you have the sign-off one other developer. If you do not have
that permission, the Merge Request will be merged by the reviewing developer.
7. Merge Requests that contain a lot more than 500 line changes may be blocked and should be broken down
into smaller ones.
